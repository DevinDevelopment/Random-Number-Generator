## Description

In this project we will generate a random password with a length of the users choice. There are character criterias that can be added to the generated password such as lowercase, upppercase, numerical values, and/or special characters. 

We were given start up code that included the html and the css and as a developer I had to add the javascript to add functionality.

In this project Ive learned the prompt() and the alert() functions along with other javascript topics such as arrays, conditional statements and queryselectors.
